                                    Microgreeny is a react E-commerce website I am making for a startup company in West Hollywood, CA. I am working with the owner directly on the design.
                                    Direct contact is constant with the owner as they are able to view the live website as it is being hosted on Github Pages. The company is still
                                    in its very early stages so not everything is going to be final.

                                <p> &emsp;With a small team, we created a compiler using Java, which would translate and output workable C code. 
                                    Our compiler would parse through the java, tokenize each syntax into a long array, parse through the array, and compile the new C code.
                                    I created the parser that read in tokens and verified the proper output. Unit tests are done in Maven.
